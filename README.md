# Material for reproducing the results of the URDF dataset analysis 

This repository contains information and results on the study performed in the preprint ["Understanding URDF: A Dataset And Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00514).

The repository is structured as follows:
* _csv\_files\_for\_tables_ contains the csv files generated using the scripts in the dataset repository. These files represent tables in the paper.
* _csv\_files\_for\_charts_ contains csv files that were used to create figures in the paper.
* _additional\_results_ contains other results related to the dataset but that have not directly been used in tables or figures.
* _additional\_information_ contains a markdown file explaining information on how the dataset was constructed and the assumptions made when processing the data.
